## Install

There are two options for installing and using RunaQueue:

### Run and install the electron app

1. Download the latest runaqueuetool-version-setup.exe file from the [releases page](https://github.com/HedgehogRidingAnOwl/RunaQueue-Tool/releases).
2. Run the executable to complete the installation.
3. The RunaQueue tool should start automatically after install. After, anytime you wish to run it you can search for and run `runaqueuetool` from the start menu.

### Run as in portable mode

1. Download the latest runaqueue_version_portable.zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/HedgehogRidingAnOwl/RunaQueue-Tool/releases).
2. Exract the contents of the file to a new folder.
3. Run `runaqueuetool.exe`.

### Optional Bot Configuration Info

If you want the tool to be able to post in chat (i.e. to inform a user they were sucessfully added or that there was an error with them joining) you will need to provide the tool with an access token for an account that can post in chat. This is optional but recommended.

You can generate an access token using [twitchtokengenerator.com](twitchtokengenerator.com).

1. Select "Bot Chat Token".
    - You will be redirected to a Twitch login page. Ensure the one shown is the one you'd like to have sending automated messages in chat. If so, select "Authorize".
2. Three token should become visible and appear as random text. Copy the value for the "Access Token", you will need this once you run RunaQueue.

## Use

### Initial Config

Fill in the values from the API Configuration section and click "Connect to Chat".

#### Optional values

- **Chat Bot Username**: The twitch account name of the account you want to post messages in chat (typically a bot account)

- **Access Token**: The acess token for the chat bot account. Instructions for generating are [above](#optional-bot-configuration-info) and at the top of the window in the RunaQueue tool.

#### Required value

- **Channel Name**: Name of the twitch channel that will be using the queue (whose chat the viewers will be interacting with)

You may optionally choose to save credentials to a config file. This is recommended for convenience but not necessary for any funtionality.

One connected the status should change to "Connected". If bot username and token aren't provided the status will be "Connected anonymously". In this state the queue will work but no status messages will be sent in stream chat.
